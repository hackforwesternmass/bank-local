Why Bank Local?
===============

This is the theme for [whybanklocal.pvlocalfirst.org](whybanklocal.pvlocalfirst.org).

The map plugin is in the branch [plugin](https://bitbucket.org/ryelle/bank-local/src/?at=plugin).

Setting up the site
-------------------

This is a WordPress site with a custom theme & plugin for a map of banks. 
To set up a dev environment, you should first have a copy of WP running 
locally. The master branch is the theme itself, so you'll put that in 
`wp-content/themes/`. If you want to use the plugin too, clone the plugin 
branch into `wp-content/plugins`.

You can then export content from the [live site](whybanklocal.pvlocalfirst.org)
to populate your dev site, however the section IDs are currently hardcoded.
